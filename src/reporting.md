# Remerge reporting API

## Introduction
remerge is an app retargeting platform. In addition to our platform's dashboard and analytical capabilities, customers are able to pull JSON-based reports from the remerge reporting API for their currently running campaigns to their internal BI on a daily granularity basis.

The performance by customer is broken down by the following five dimensions: timestamp, country, App, campaign and related ads. Therefore, the results can be easly imported and sliced and diced by the provided dimensions in any Business Intelligence platform of the customer's choice.

## Endpoint

The API is accessible via the following endpoint:

      https://api.remerge.io/report

## Request Parameters

The API provides a simple interface to query data. A start and end date are the only parameters required.

name | content | examples | mandatory
:------------ | :------------- | :------------ | :------------
start_date| Starting date of report (YYYY-MM-DD)|2017-01-09| x
end_date|End date of report (YYYY-MM-DD)|2017-01-10| x
dimensions|Comma seperated list of dimensions to split the aggregates by. Defaults to _audience,country,campaign,ad_ if not passed. Possible values are _audience, country, campaign, ad, platform_.|country,platform| 

A valid request would look like: https://api.remerge.io/report?start_date=2017-01-10&end_date=2017-01-11&dimensions=campaign,ad

## Authorization

In addition the request must be authorized. To get the necessary information for the authorization token please contact your remerge Account Manager or issue a sign in request to api.remerge.io.

Sign in request example.

```curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -X POST htd '{"user" : { "email" : "your@email.com", "password": "password"}}'```

Which returns the needed token as JSON.
