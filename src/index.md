To provide updates to audience segments in real time customers who don't use an attributions provider supported by remerge (like [Adjust](http://www.adjust.com)) or want to use an internal tracking solution, can forward events to the remerge tracking API. Customer who want to integrate remerge campaign reports with their own data sets can use the remerge reporting API.
