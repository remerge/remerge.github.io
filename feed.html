<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header-link" href="#introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>remerge does support dynamic creatives. Dynamic creatives contain placeholders which are filled with data that is specific to the user who is seeing the advertisement. Examples are titles, prices, call to actions, deeplinks or images. The most compelling creatives are powered by a product feed which contains these data points and is indexed by the users past activity. To simplify the setup of campaigns that leverage dynamic creative powered by a product feed, the feed has to fulfill the following requirements.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header-link" href="#requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="feed-availability"><a class="header-link" href="#feed-availability"></a>Feed availability</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>the feed must be available via http/https (for example on S3) or SFTP</li>
<li>credentials to access the feed must be supplied to remerge ahead of time</li>
<li>remerge is going to update the feed every 24h</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feed-format"><a class="header-link" href="#feed-format"></a>Feed format</h3>
<p>The feed needs to be a CSV file (can be gezipped).</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Unicode (UTF-8) should be used as character set (a byte order mark should not be used)</li>
<li>the column delimiter should be a comma</li>
<li>each row must contain the same number of fields</li>
<li>the csv must contain a header with column names</li>
<li>column names should be alpha numeric but must begin with a letter</li>
<li>column names should be can be camel cased or snake cased</li>
<li>column names are not allowed to include spaces and other special characters</li>
<li>fields can be quoted (double quotes)</li>
<li>fields containing a comma or quotes must be quoted</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feed-content"><a class="header-link" href="#feed-content"></a>Feed content</h3>
<p>The feed can have many columns but at least one ID column is required.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>an ID column should exist</li>
<li>IDs should be alpha numeric</li>
<li>IDs should be unique</li>
</ul>
<p>To build compelling creatives columns for a custom title, image and deeplink should always be included. If the campaign is targeting iOS and Android, OS specific deeplink columns are necessary. To accommodate different creative formats at least two different image links should be included (sizes depend on the template used for the campaign).</p>
<p>Data duplication or derived data should be avoided in the feed. For example:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>if every deeplink starts with the same prefix, please avoid the prefix</li>
<li>if the only changing part in a deeplink is the product ID a deeplink column is not needed at all</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="indexing-the-feed"><a class="header-link" href="#indexing-the-feed"></a>Indexing the feed</h3>
<p>The ID used to index a feed is usually supplied within the app event attribution stream. For example, a ProductViewed event should contain the ID of the product as additional data.</p>
